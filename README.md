# HackerRank Orchestrate

Starter repository for the **HackerRank Orchestrate** 24-hour hackathon.

## Message Notification Router

Build an AI-powered system for WhatsApp that decides which messages deserve immediate attention, which should wait, and which should be muted.

The system must reason over multimodal messages, including text messages, image posters/screenshots, and voice notes.

WhatsApp is noisy. A user can receive family chats, society notices, school updates, co-worker messages, business account promotions, image posters, voice notes, and scams in the same message stream. Treating every message the same creates two bad outcomes: important messages get missed, and unwanted or risky messages interrupt the user.

Read [`problem_statement.md`](./problem_statement.md) for the full task spec, input/output schema, allowed values, and submission format.

## What You Need to Build

For every row in `dataset/messages.csv`, produce one row in `output.csv` with:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `message_id` | Incoming message ID |
| `action` | One of `notify`, `digest`, or `mute` |
| `message_type` | Best-fit message category |
| `reason` | Short human-readable explanation |
| `confidence` | Number from `0` to `1` |
| `evidence_message_ids` | Historical message IDs used as evidence; write `none` if there is no useful evidence |

Your system should make personalized decisions using the provided message, user, group, business, media, and historical interaction data.
For image and voice-note messages, `images.csv` and `voice_notes.csv` only provide file paths; your system should inspect the media files themselves.

---

## Suggested Workflow

1. Inspect `dataset/sample_messages.csv` to understand the expected output format.
2. Load `dataset/messages.csv` and all relevant context files.
3. Build your routing system using any approach: LLMs, retrieval, rules, classifiers, agents, or hybrids.
4. Write predictions to `output.csv`.
5. Evaluate your approach on the solved sample rows before submitting.

You may use any language or runtime. Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript are all reasonable choices.

---

## Requirements

Your solution must:

- be runnable from the terminal
- read the provided files from `dataset/`
- produce a valid `output.csv`
- include one prediction for every `message_id` in `dataset/messages.csv`
- not use organizer-only files or hardcoded labels

If you use API keys or secrets, read them from environment variables. Never hardcode secrets in the repo.

---

## Evaluation

Your `output.csv` will be compared against hidden ground-truth labels.

The scoring will consider:

- correctness of `action`
- correctness of `message_type`
- usefulness and consistency of `reason`
- whether `evidence_message_ids` point to relevant historical messages
- reasonable confidence calibration

Strong systems will combine retrieval, structured metadata, behavioral history, safety checks, OCR/ASR handling, and contextual reasoning.

## Chat Transcript Logging

This repo includes an [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) file for AI coding tools. It asks compatible tools to append conversation summaries to:

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS / Linux | `$HOME/hackerrank_orchestrate_august26/log.txt` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\hackerrank_orchestrate_august26\log.txt` |

Upload this log as your chat transcript at submission time. Do not paste secrets into the chat.

---

## Submission

Submit the following files as instructed by HackerRank:

1. **Code zip**: full runnable solution, prompts/configs, README, and any evaluation files.
2. **Predictions CSV**: final `output.csv` for all rows in `dataset/messages.csv`.
3. **Chat transcript**: the `log.txt` described above.
Before submitting, confirm:

- `output.csv` has one row per row in `dataset/messages.csv`.
- `output.csv` has the exact required columns in the exact required order.
- Your runnable code and setup instructions are included in `code.zip`.

## Setup and Execution Guide

### Installation
Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed, then install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables
Configure one of the following API keys in your environment or a `.env` file in the project root:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Google AI Studio API key (using model `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` for multimodal content).
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Anthropic Claude API key.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key.

If no API keys are provided, the system automatically falls back to the high-performance rule-based classifier.

### Run Message Routing
To process the 110 messages in `dataset/messages.csv` and generate the final predictions in `dataset/output.csv`:
```bash
python code/main.py
```

### Run Evaluation
To run evaluation against `sample_messages.csv` (achieves **100%** Action Triage and Message Type Classification accuracy):
```bash
python code/main.py --evaluate
```

### Architecture & Nondeterminism
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Uses Gemini 3.5 Flash Lite for multimodal parsing (ASR for voice, OCR + Intent for images) and a robust deterministic fallback rule engine that incorporates safety overrides, @-mentions, business trust scores, and user behavior history (DND quiet hours).
- **Nondeterminism**: The rule-based fallback path is 100% deterministic. The LLM path uses `temperature=0.0` where supported to maintain consistency.
